# Embed On the Web {#embed}
So far you've learned how to create [charts in chapter 7](chart.html), [maps in chapter 8](map.html), and [tables in chapter 9](table.html). Our book emphasizes the benefits of designing *interactive* visualizations that engage broad audiences on the internet by inviting them to interact with your data, investigate new patterns, download files if desired, and easily share your work on social media. In this chapter, you'll learn about a computer code tag called an *iframe*, which allows readers to actively explore your data on a different page. Like a picture frame, an iframe displays a live web page (such as your interactive data visualization) inside a second web page that you control (such as your personal or organizational web site), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:iframe-illustration). When done correctly, the iframe makes your data visualization appear seamlessly on your web page, so that audiences can explore the content without needing to know that it's coming from a different host. Several of the visualization tools you've learned so far, such as Google Sheets, Datawrapper, and Tableau Public, generate an *embed code* that contains an iframe to the online chart or map you've created on their platform. We will demonstrate how to [get the embed code or link](embed-code.html) from your visualization tool site, and [paste the code into a second website](paste-code.html) to seamlessly display your interactive content. No coding skills are required in this introductory book, but it certainly helps to be *code-curious*.

(ref:iframe-illustration) You can use an iframe to embed other web pages in your web page

```{r iframe-illustration, out.width=600, fig.cap="(ref:iframe-illustration)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/iframe-illustration.png")
```

## Static Image vs Interactive iframe {- #static}
First, let's clarify the difference between *static* versus *interactive* visualizations. A static picture of a chart or map is a frozen image. Many visualization tools allow you to download static images of your charts or maps in .JPG or .PNG or .PDF format. Static images are useful when that's all that you want to insert in a document, a presentation slide, or even a web page. Another option is to paste a static image, and add a link [or custom shortlink](share.html) with the web address to an interactive chart or map, and invite audiences to explore it online.

If you need to capture a static image of any web page on your computer, take a [screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot) with these built-in commands:

- Chromebook: *Shift + Ctrl + F5* (the *show windows* button), then click-and-drag the cross-hair cursor.
- Macintosh: *Shift + Command + 4*, then click-and-drag the cross-hair cursor to capture screenshot.
- Windows: *Windows logo key + Shift + S* to call up the *Snip & Sketch* tool.

A related strategy is an animated GIF, which is a series of static images that captures motion on the screen. You can insert an animated GIF file on a web page to illustrate a short sequence of steps while using an interactive visualization, but audiences cannot interact with it, other than to play the animated loop over again. Paid software tools such as [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) allow you to create screenshots including drop-down menus and cursors, animated GIFs, and more.

By contrast, *interactive* visualizations allow audiences to directly engage with your data story through their web browsers. Visitors usually can float their cursor over a chart to view tooltips or underlying information, or zoom into a map and pan around, or search terms or sort columns in an interactive table. Interactive visualizations are usually hosted online, such as a chart or map tool platform, and are primarily designed to be viewed online, though in some cases it's possible for you to download and interact with them on your local computer.

Now let's turn to the central question: how can we make an interactive visualization, which resides on its online host (the primary site), appear seamlessly on a different website that we control (the secondary site)?. While it's possible to insert a link on our secondary site to the charts or maps on the primary site, that's inconvenient for our audiences because it requires them to click away from the web page they were reading. A better solution is to insert an embed code that usually contains an [iframe tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp), written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the code that displays content inside our web browsers. While you don't need any coding experience, you'll benefit in the long run by learning how to recognize the core features of an embed code and how it works.

In its simplest form, an iframe instructs the secondary site to display a web page address from the primary site, known as the source, as if it were a seamless picture frame on the wall of a room. The sample iframe code below begins with a start tag `<iframe ... >`, which contains the source `src='https://...'` with either single- or double-quotes around the primary site URL, then concludes with an end tag `</iframe>`. This sample iframe refers to an interactive US income inequality chart on the Datawrapper platform, which first appeared in the [Introduction](introduction.html) to this book, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:iframe-sample).

`<iframe src='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LtRbj/'></iframe>`

(ref:iframe-sample) Depending on the format of your book, if a static chart appears above, but you can also [view the interactive version](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LtRbj/).

```{r iframe-sample, fig.cap="(ref:iframe-sample)"}
if(knitr::is_html_output(excludes="markdown")) knitr::include_url("https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LtRbj/") else knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/iframe-sample.png")
```

When you copy an embed code from some of the visualization tools featured in this book, their iframe tags may be *much longer* than the simple example above. For example, an iframe tag might include other attributes, such as `width` or `height`, measured in pixels (`px`) or a percentage of its dimensions on the secondary site. Also, you may see other iframe tag elements, such as `seamless` or `frameborder="0"` or `scrolling="no"`, which create a seamless appearance between the iframe content and its surroundings. Finally, you may see *really long* embed codes that contain a dozen or more lines of code that even we don't fully understand. That's okay, because all of these are optional add-ons to improve the appearance of the iframe in the secondary site. The most essential ingredient of an embed code is the iframe and its three core parts: the iframe start tag, source web address, and end tag. When in doubt, look for those key ingredients.

Now that you have a clearer definition of an interactive visualization, embed codes, and iframe tags, in the next section we'll learn how to copy the embed code from different visualization platforms.

## Get the Embed Code or iframe Tag {- #embed-code}
In this section, you'll learn how to copy the embed code or iframe tag that is automatically generated when you publish a chart or map on different visualization platforms featured in this book. Remember that embed codes contain the essential iframe tag, along with other bits of code to display the chart or map from the primary site and make it appear seamlessly on the secondary site.

We'll break this down into three steps for each visualization platform. First, we will demonstrate how to copy your embed code or iframe tag from Google Sheets, Datawrapper, Tableau Public, and other platforms listed below. Second, we'll show you how to test the embed code or iframe tag in a wonderful assistant called the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:w3schools-tryit-iframe). It's a great way to see what happens if you need to trim parts of the embed code before placing it in web page, and test if it still works. Third, we'll point you to the next section to learn how to properly paste the embed code in your preferred website, including common platforms such as WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix, and Weebly.

(ref:w3schools-tryit-iframe) For each embed code below, paste it in place of the selected text of the W3Schools TryIt iframe page to test how it works.

```{r w3schools-tryit-iframe, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:w3schools-tryit-iframe)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/w3schools-tryit-iframe.png")
```

### from Google Sheets {-}
1. After you create a [Google Sheets chart as you did in Chapter 7](chart-google.html), click the 3-dot kebab menu in the upper-right corner of the chart to publish it, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:google-sheets-publish).

(ref:google-sheets-publish) In your chart, click the three-dot kebab menu to publish it.

```{r google-sheets-publish, out.width=150, fig.cap="(ref:google-sheets-publish)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/google-sheets-publish.png")
```

2. In the next screen, select the *Embed* tab and *Interactive* chart, and click the *Publish* button to share it online. Select and copy the embed code, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:google-sheets-embed-code).

(ref:google-sheets-embed-code) Click *Embed* and *Interactive* and *Publish*, then select and copy the embed code.

```{r google-sheets-embed-code, out.width=500, fig.cap="(ref:google-sheets-embed-code)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/google-sheets-embed-code.png")
```

3. To better understand how the embed code works, open the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe). Select the current iframe tag, paste in your embed code to replace it, and press the green *Run* button. The result should be similar to Figure \@ref(fig:google-sheets-tryit), but instead will display your embed code and interactive visualization.

(ref:google-sheets-tryit) Paste your Google Sheets embed code to place of the current iframe tag in the TryIt page and click *Run*.

```{r google-sheets-tryit, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:google-sheets-tryit)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/google-sheets-tryit.png")
```

At first glance, the Google Sheets embed code may appear long, but it's actually a straightforward iframe tag with a long source link. Look closely and you'll see iframe settings such as `width` and `height` (measured here in pixels), and `seamless` and `frameborder='0'` and `scrolling='no'` to improve its appearance.

4. Now jump to the [paste code to website section](paste-code.html) of this chapter to learn how to properly insert your embed code into your preferred platform.

### from Datawrapper {-}
1. After you create a [Datawrapper chart as you did in Chapter 7](chart-datawrapper.html) or [map as you did in Chapter 8](map.html) or [interactive table as you did Chapter 9](table.html), proceed to the final screen and click the *Publish* button, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:datawrapper-publish). This publishes the interactive version of your chart or map online. Further down on the same screen you can also export a static image, if desired.

(ref:datawrapper-publish) Proceed to the final screen and click the *Publish* button.

```{r datawrapper-publish, out.width=300, fig.cap="(ref:datawrapper-publish)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/datawrapper-publish.png")
```

2. On the next screen, click *copy* to get the Datawrapper embed code, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:datawrapper-embed-code). The default *responsive iframe* version of the embed code contains additional instructions to improve its appearance on both small and large device screens.

(ref:datawrapper-embed-code) Copy the responsive iframe version of the Datawrapper embed code.

```{r datawrapper-embed-code, out.width=300, fig.cap="(ref:datawrapper-embed-code)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/datawrapper-embed-code.png")
```

3. To better understand how the embed code works, open the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe). Select the current iframe tag, paste in your embed code to replace it, and press the green *Run* button. The result should be similar to Figure \@ref(fig:datawrapper-tryit), but instead will display your unique embed code and interactive visualization.

(ref:datawrapper-tryit) Paste your Datawrapper embed code in place of the current iframe tag in the TryIt page and click *Run*.

```{r datawrapper-tryit, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:datawrapper-tryit)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/datawrapper-tryit.png")
```

The Datawrapper embed code is *long*, but if you look closely, the first half contains a relatively straightforward iframe tag that includes familiar-looking attributes such `src`,`scrolling`, and `frameborder`, and `width` and `height` inside a style tag. The second half of the embed code contains JavaScript instructions to make the iframe appear responsive depending on the size of the device screen.

4. Always try to paste the *full embed code* in your desired web platform. Jump to the [paste code to website section](paste-code.html) of this chapter to learn how to properly insert your embed code into common websites.

Tip: But if it doesn't work, go back to step 3 and experiment. Try to edit the embed code down to a *simple iframe*, and run it again to see how it looks, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:datawrapper-tryit-simple). Sometimes a simple iframe works better on your website than a complex embed code.

(ref:datawrapper-tryit-simple) If a complex embed code does not work in your website, go back and try to edit it down into a simple iframe.

```{r datawrapper-tryit-simple, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:datawrapper-tryit-simple)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/datawrapper-tryit-simple.png")
```

Hint: The Datawrapper iframe tag source follows this general format: `https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/abcdef/1/`, where the `1` refers to the first version of the chart or map you published. If you make edits and re-publish your visualization, Datawrapper will increase the last digit (to `2` and so forth), and *automatically redirect* older links to the *current version*, which keeps your work up-to-date for your audience.

### from Tableau Public {-}
1. After you create a [Tableau Public chart in Chapter 7](chart-tableau.html) or [map in Chapter 8](map-tableau.html), publish your worksheet, dashboard, or story online by selecting *File > Save to Tableau Public* in the desktop application menu, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-publish).

(ref:tableau-public-publish) In the Tableau Public desktop application, select *File--Save to Tableau Public* to publish to the online server.

```{r tableau-public-publish, out.width=428, fig.cap="(ref:tableau-public-publish)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/tableau-public-publish.png")
```

2. In your online Tableau Public account profile page, click to *View* the details of any of your published visualizations, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-view).

(ref:tableau-public-view) In your Tableau Public online profile page, click to *View* the details of a published visualization.

```{r tableau-public-view, out.width=289, fig.cap="(ref:tableau-public-view)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/tableau-public-view.png")
```

Tip: All of your published visualizations appear under your username account profile on the [Tableau Public server](https://public.tableau.com). If you don't recall your username, search the Tableau Public server for your first and last name that you entered when creating your online account.

3. When viewing details for a published visualization in your Tableau Public online account, scroll down and click on the *Share* symbol in the lower-right corner. Select and copy its embed code, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-embed-code).

(ref:tableau-public-embed-code) Scroll down in the online published visualization details, click the *Share* button, and copy the embed code.

```{r tableau-public-embed-code, out.width=469, fig.cap="(ref:tableau-public-embed-code)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/tableau-public-embed-code-annotated.png")
```

4. To better understand how the embed code works, open the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe). Select the current iframe tag, paste in your embed code to replace it, and press the green *Run* button. The result should be similar to Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-tryit), but instead will display your embed code and interactive visualization. Note how the Tableau Public embed code is so long that it does not fit in this image.

(ref:tableau-public-tryit) Paste your Tableau public embed code in place of the current iframe tag in the TryIt page and click *Run*.

```{r tableau-public-tryit, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:tableau-public-tryit)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/tableau-public-tryit.png")
```

5. Always try to paste the *full embed code* in your desired web platform. Jump to the [paste code to website section](paste-code.html) of this chapter to learn how to properly insert on different common websites.


However, if your web platform does not accept the *full embed code* for Tableau Public, the next strategy is to try to copy the Tableau Public link to your visualization and convert it into a *simpler iframe tag*, and see how it works in your website. Here's how to copy and convert it.

1. In your published visualization on your Tableau Public online account, scroll down and click on the *Share* symbol in the lower-right corner, as previously shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-embed-code). But this time, select and copy its *link*, not the *embed code*. A typical link looks similar to this one:

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link`

2. Paste the link into the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe), and delete all of the code that appears *after* the question mark (`?`), so that it looks like this:

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?`

3. At the end, attach this code snippet to replace what you deleted above:

`:showVizHome=no&:embed=true`

4. Now your edited link should look like this:

`https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true`

5. Enclose your edit link inside an iframe source tag `src=` with quotes, to make it look similar to this:

`src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" `

6. Add iframe start and end tags, and also attributes for `width`, `height`, `seamless`, `frameborder="0"`, and `scrolling="no"`, to make it look similar to this:

`<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CTSchoolDistrictsbyIncomeandGradeLevels2009-13/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true" width="90%" height="500" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>`

Hint: Insert `width="90%"`, rather than 100%, to help readers to scroll more easily down your web page with a margin.

7. Press *Run* to see how it looks in the W3Schools TryIt iframe page, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tableau-public-tryit-simple). Sometimes a simple iframe works better on your website than a complex embed code.

(ref:tableau-public-tryit-simple) If a complex embed code does not work in your website, go back and copy the link to the visualization, and try to convert it into a simple iframe.

```{r tableau-public-tryit-simple, out.width=750, fig.cap="(ref:tableau-public-tryit-simple)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/tableau-public-tryit-simple.png")
```

Learn more about [how to embed an iframe on the Tableau Public support page](https://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/embedding-tableau-public-views-in-iframes).


Now that you have a better sense of how to copy embed codes, and edit them down to simpler iframes if needed, in the next section you'll learn how to paste them into common websites to share your interactive visualizations with wider audiences.

## Paste Code or iframe to Website {- #paste-code}
In the prior section, you learned how to copy the embed code or create an iframe for your interactive visualization that is hosted online by the primary site. For example, your live chart or map might be hosted on a Google Sheets, Datawrapper, or Tableau Public server. In this section, we'll demonstrate ways to properly paste the embed code or iframe to seamlessly display your interactive chart or map on a secondary website that you control, and we'll focus on common web-building platforms such as WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix, and Weebly. Even if your website runs on a different platform, the principles will likely be the same.

### to WordPress.com sites {-}
If you own *free* or personal or premium [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) site, with a web address in the format `anyone.wordpress.com`, you *cannot* insert an embed code that contains an iframe or Javascript due to security concerns, as described on their [support page](https://wordpress.com/support/troubleshooting-embed-links-and-shortcodes/). This means that if wish to show data visualizations created from this book on a WordPress.com site, you have two options. First, with your free or personal or premium plan, you can still insert a *static image* of a chart or map and a link to its interactive site, but that's clearly not ideal. Second, WordPress.com suggests that you can [update to their paid Business or eCommerce plan](https://wordpress.com/support/plan-features/), which supports embed codes that contain iframes or Javascript, following instructions similar to the self-hosted WordPress sites below.

### to Self-hosted WordPress sites {-}
Make sure you [understand the difference](https://wordpress.com/support/com-vs-org/) between a WordPress.com site above versus a self-hosted WordPress site. The latter is sometimes called WordPress.org site because anyone can freely download the software from that address and *host it on their own webserver*, or more commonly, have access to a self-hosted WordPress server through their school or work, or by renting space on a vendor's webserver. But the web address of a self-hosted WordPress site does *not* necessarily need to end in `.org`. It also could be `.com` or `.edu` or any other ending, so don't let that confuse you.

There are two ways to insert an embed code or iframe in a self-hosted WordPress site, but your success may depend on your WP version, your access level, and the complexity of the code. We'll show you both Method A (which is simpler, but not always reliable) and Method B (which requires a few more steps, but works more reliably). See which method works best for your self-hosted WordPress site.

#### Method A: Simple, But Not Always Reliable {-}
Assume that you're using self-hosted WordPress version 5.0 or above with the newer block editor, and you have editor or administrator access to your site. (This method does not work reliably with author-level access or below.)

1. In your block editor, select a *custom HTML* block, and directly insert the embed code or the iframe, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:wordpress-custom-html).  

(ref:wordpress-custom-html) Paste an embed code or iframe into a custom HTML block.

```{r wordpress-custom-html, out.width=700, fig.cap="(ref:wordpress-custom-html)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/wordpress-custom-html.png")
```

2. Preview your WordPress page or post, and if your iframe appears, publish and view it in another browser to test how it appears to your readers.

#### Method B: More Steps, But More Reliable {-}
Assume that you're using self-hosted WordPress, any version, with either the classic or block editor, and that you have author-level or above access to the site.

1. First, the site administrator must install and activate the [iframe plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:wordpress-iframe-plugin). This plugin allows authors to embed iframe codes in a modified "shortcode" format surrounded by square brackets in this general format: `[iframe...]`.

(ref:wordpress-iframe-plugin) Install and activate the *iframe* plugin on a self-hosted WordPress site.

```{r wordpress-iframe-plugin, out.width=287, fig.cap="(ref:wordpress-iframe-plugin)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/wordpress-iframe-plugin.png")
```

2. In the WordPress block editor, click to add a *Custom HTML* block (or in the classic editor, click the *text* tab to view the HTML code). Paste the embed code or iframe, which initially should appear similar to the prior Figure \@ref(fig:wordpress-custom-html).

3. Initially, the code you pasted probably included HTML iframe tags at the start (`<iframe...`) and the end (`...></iframe>`). Modify the start tag by replacing the less-than symbol (`<`) with a square opening bracket (`[`). Modify the back end by erasing the greater-than symbol *and* the entire end tag (`> </iframe>`), and replacing both of them with one square closing bracket (`]`), as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:wordpress-insert-brackets). Closely compare the two figures to see what these small code edits look like.

(ref:wordpress-insert-brackets) Modify the front and back end with square brackets.

```{r wordpress-insert-brackets, out.width=700, fig.cap="(ref:wordpress-insert-brackets)"}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/10-embed/wordpress-insert-brackets.png")
```

Tip: For long embed codes from Datawrapper and Tableau Public, you may need to experiment with trimming it down to the most relevant portions of the iframe using the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe), as described in the prior section, then pasting into the WordPress editor and modifying the front and back end with square brackets.

4. Preview your WordPress page or post, and if your iframe appears, publish and view it in another browser to test how it appears to your readers.

### to SquareSpace, Wix, Weebly, or Other Web-Building Sites {-}
The concept of pasting your data visualization iframes or embed codes to other web-building sites is similar to WordPress, but details will vary, depending on freemium versus paid subscription level and author-administrator status. Here are details for three of the most popular web-building services:

See these SquareSpace support pages about [embed blocks](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543617-Embed-Blocks) and [adding custom code to your site](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815928-Adding-custom-code-to-your-site#toc-code-blocks-vs--embed-blocks).

See this Wix support page about [using iframes to display content on your site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-using-iframes-to-display-visible-content-on-your-site).

See Weebly support page about [adding external content and widgets with embedded code](https://www.weebly.com/app/help/us/en/topics/create-widgets-embed-code-and-add-external-content).

Tip: When working with long or complex embed codes, you may need to experiment with pasting and trimming down to the most relevant portion of the iframe in the [W3Schools TryIt iframe page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe), then pasting that portion into your web-builder platform.

### Summary {- #summary10}

In this chapter, you learned about iframes and embed codes, and how they seamlessly display your interactive data visualization from their home site onto a second website that you personally manage. This concept will be valuable in the next chapter, where you will learn how to edit and host open-source code templates on the GitHub platform, because you can also create iframes to make those charts and maps seamlessly appear on your own website.
